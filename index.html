  <h1>Happy Mother's Day Mumma</h1>

  <p>
    To the Most Beautiful Soul<br><br>
    Dear Ma,<br><br>
    Happy Motherâ€™s Day, my angel. Today, even though weâ€™re miles apart, your love still wraps around me and Thammudu like a warm blanket.<br><br>
    Youâ€™ve been our lighthouse in every storm, a soft place to land when life gets hard.<br><br>
    We see you. We see the way you give without asking for anything back. We see the way you loveâ€”quietly, deeply, endlessly.<br><br>
    Even now, you are in a different country, but our hearts beat with yours, always.<br><br>
    You forgive more than anyone should. You care more than anyone ever does. And still, you smile, still, you hold strength. Thatâ€™s not weakness. Thatâ€™s your superpower, Mumma.<br><br>
    I know today, in the middle of all the celebrations there, your heart may ache for your own children, your own hugs, your own chaos. But please know â€” you're not alone. Not even for a second.<br><br>
    Close your eyes, Ma, and feel us there â€” holding your hand, lying next to you, telling you that youâ€™re the best mother in this universe. No one compares.<br><br>
    Thank you for being our world. And one day, weâ€™ll make sure the world treats you the way you deserve.<br><br>
    We love you more than words can ever say.<br><br>
    Forever your little ones,<br>
    Bujjamma and Kannayya
  </p>

    Canâ€™t wait to meet you, Ma.</p>
