        <p>Dear Ma,</p>
        <p>Happy Mother’s Day, my angel.<br>
        Today, even though we’re miles apart,<br>
        Your love still wraps around me and thammudu like a warm blanket.<br>
        You’ve been our lighthouse in every storm,<br>
        A soft place to land when life gets hard.</p>
        <p>We see you.<br>
        We see the way you give without asking for anything back.<br>
        We see the way you love—quietly, deeply, endlessly.<br>
        Even now, you are in a different country,<br>
        But our hearts beat with yours, always.</p>
        <p>You forgive more than anyone should,<br>
        You care more than anyone ever does.<br>
        And still, you smile, still, you hold strength.<br>
        That’s not weakness. That’s your superpower, mumma.</p>
        <p>I know today, in the middle of all the celebrations there,<br>
        Your heart may ache for your own children,<br>
        Your own hugs, your own chaos.<br>
        But please know — you're not alone.<br>
        Not even for a second.</p>
        <p>Close your eyes, ma, and feel us there —<br>
        Holding your hand, lying next to you,<br>
        Telling you that you’re the best mother in this universe.<br>
        No one compares.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being our world.<br>
        And one day, we’ll make sure the world treats you the way you deserve.</p>
        <p>We love you more than words can ever say.<br>
        <strong>Forever your little ones,<br>Bujjamma and Kannayya</strong></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="page final">
      <p><strong>We love you so much, Ma!</strong><br>
      Look at that gorgeous smile on your face now.<br>
      We can’t wait to meet you, Ma.</p>
