          <h2>To the Most Beautiful Soul — My Amma, My Heart</h2>
          <p>Dear Ma,</p>
          <p>
            Happy Mother’s Day, my angel.<br>
            Today, even though we’re miles apart, your love still wraps around me and thammudu like a warm blanket.<br><br>
            You’ve been our lighthouse in every storm, a soft place to land when life gets hard.<br><br>
            We see you.<br>
            We see the way you give without asking for anything back. We see the way you love — quietly, deeply, endlessly.<br>
            Even now, you are in a different country, but our hearts beat with yours, always.<br><br>
            You forgive more than anyone should. You care more than anyone ever does. And still, you smile. Still, you hold strength.<br>
            That’s not weakness. That’s your superpower, mumma.<br><br>
            I know today, in the middle of all the celebrations there, your heart may ache for your own children, your own hugs, your own chaos.<br>
            But please know — you're not alone. Not even for a second.<br><br>
            Close your eyes, ma, and feel us there — holding your hand, lying next to you, telling you that you’re the best mother in this universe. No one compares.<br><br>
            Thank you for being our world.<br>
            And one day, we’ll make sure the world treats you the way you deserve.<br><br>
            <strong>Forever your little ones,<br>Bujjamma and Kannayya</strong>
