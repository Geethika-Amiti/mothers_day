            <h2>My Amma, My Heart</h2>
            <p>Dear Ma,<br><br>
              Happy Mother’s Day, my angel. Today, even though we’re miles apart,
              your love still wraps around me and Thammudu like a warm blanket.<br><br>
              You’ve been our lighthouse in every storm, a soft place to land when life gets hard.<br><br>
              We see you. We see the way you give without asking for anything back. We see the way you love—quietly, deeply, endlessly.<br><br>
              Even now, you are in a different country, but our hearts beat with yours, always.<br><br>
              You forgive more than anyone should. You care more than anyone ever does. And still, you smile, still, you hold strength.
              That’s not weakness. That’s your superpower, Mumma.<br><br>
              I know today, in the middle of all the celebrations there, your heart may ache for your own children, your own hugs, your own chaos.
              But please know — you're not alone. Not even for a second.<br><br>
              Close your eyes, Ma, and feel us there — holding your hand, lying next to you, telling you that you’re the best mother in this universe. No one compares.<br><br>
              Thank you for being our world. And one day, we’ll make sure the world treats you the way you deserve.<br><br>
              We love you more than words can ever say.<br><br>
              Forever your little ones,<br>
              Bujjamma and Kannayya

          Can’t wait to meet you, Ma.</p>
